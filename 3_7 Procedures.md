* Procedures are a key abstraction in software.
	* Provide a way to package code that implements some functionality with a designated set of arguments and an optional return value.
* Procedures come in many guises in different programming languages — functions, methods, subroutines, handlers, and so on — but they all share a general set of features.
* suppose procedure P calls procedure Q, and Q then executes and returns back to P. These actions involve one or more of the following mechanisms:
	* **Passing control** - The program counter must be set to the starting address of the code for Q upon entry and then set to the instruction in P following the call to Q upon return.
	* **Passing data** - P must be able to provide one or more parameters to Q, and Q must be able to return a value back to P.
	* **Allocating and deallocating memory** - Q may need to allocate space for local variables when it begins and then free that storage before it returns.

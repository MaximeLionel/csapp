* The **floating-point architecture** for a processor consists of:
	* How floating-point values are stored and accessed - some registers.
	* Instructions that operate on floating-point data.
	* The conventions used for passing floating-point values as arguments to functions and for returning them as results.
	* The conventions for how registers are preserved during function calls.

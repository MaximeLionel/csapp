* In hardware design, electronic circuits are used to **compute functions on bits** and to **store bits** in different kinds of memory elements. 
* Most contemporary circuit technology represents different bit values as high or low voltages on signal wires.
	* Logic value 1 is represented by a high voltage of around 1.0 volt.
	* Logic value 0 is represented by a low voltage of around 0.0 volts. 
* 3 major components are required to implement a digital system: **combinational logic to ==compute== functions on the bits, memory elements to ==store== bits, and ==clock signals== to regulate the updating of the memory elements**.
* HCL (hardware control language) - the language that we use to describe the control logic of the different processor designs.

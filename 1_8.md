## 1.8 Systems Communicate with Other Systems Using Networks

* In practice, modern systems are often linked to other systems by networks.

* From the point of view of an individual system, the network can be viewed as just another I/O device:

  * When the system copies a sequence of bytes from main memory to the network adapter, the data ï¬‚ow across the network to another machine, instead of, say, to a local disk drive. 
  * Similarly, the system can read data sent from other machines and copy these data to its main memory.

* Steps of running hello on a remote machine:
  * Suppose we use a telnet client running on our local machine to connect to a telnet server on a remote machine.
  * After we log in to the remote machine and run a shell, the remote shell is waiting to receive an input command.
  * After we type in the hello string to the telnet client and hit the enter key, the client sends the string to the telnet server.
  * After the telnet server receives the string from the network, it passes it along to the remote shell program.
  * the remote shell runs the hello program and passes the output string back to the telnet server.
  * the telnet server forwards the output string across the network to the telnet client, which prints the output string on our local terminal.

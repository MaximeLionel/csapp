## 1.3 It Pays to Understand How Compilation Systems Work

```
本节主要强调了理解编译系统工作原理的重要性。
```



Why programmers need to understand how compilation systems work:

* Optimizing program performance.
  * 'switch' and 'if-else'
  * overhead of a function call
  * 'while' and 'for' loop
  * pointer references and array indexes
* Understanding link-time errors.
  * 'it cannot resolve a reference'
  * Static and global variable
  * 2 global variables with the same name
  * static and dynamic library
* Avoiding security holes.
  * buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

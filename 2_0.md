# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information 

* Modern computers store and process information represented as two-valued signals: 0 and 1.

  * Each bit is 0 or 1, by using analog signal
  * Reliably transmitted on noisy and inaccurate wires

* In isolation, a single bit is not very useful. When we group bits together and apply some ==interpretation== that gives meaning to the different possible bit patterns, however, we can represent the elements of any ﬁnite set, which is ==encoding==.

* 3 most important representations of numbers:

  * Unsigned encoding (无符号编码) - the traditional way and representing numbers greater than or equal to 0.
  * Two’s-complement encodings (补码编码) - the most common way to represent signed integers, that is, numbers that may be either positive or negative.
  * Floating-point encodings - a base-2 version of scientiﬁc notation for representing real numbers(实数).
    * 实数 - 有理数和无理数的集合。

* Some tips:

  * Overflow - Computer representations use a limited number of bits to encode a number, and hence some operations can ==overﬂow== when the results are too large to be represented.

  ```
  lldb: print 200*300*400*500
  ```

  * Integer computer arithmetic satisﬁes many of the familiar properties of true integer arithmetic: multiplication is associative and commutative.

  ```
  lldb:
  print 200*300*400*500
  print 200*300*(400*500)
  print 200*400*300*500
  ```

  * Floating-point arithmetic has altogether different mathematical properties.

    * The product(乘积) of a set of positive numbers will always be positive, although overﬂow will yield the special value + ∞.

    * Floating-point arithmetic is not associative due to the ﬁnite precision of the representation.

      ```
      lldb:
      print (3.14+1e20)-1e20
      print 3.14+(1e20-1e20)
      ```

  * To summarize, integer representations can encode a comparatively **small range of values, but do so precisely**, while ﬂoating-point representations can encode **a wide range of values, but only approximately**.

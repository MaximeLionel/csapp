* Machine code provides two basic low-level mechanisms for implementing conditional behavior: it tests data values and then alters either the ==control flow== or the ==data flow== based on the results of these tests.
* The execution order of a set of machine code instructions can be altered with a `jump` instruction, indicating that control should pass to some other part of the program, possibly contingent on the result of some test.

# 3.6.1 Condition Codes
* CPU maintains a set of single-bit condition code registers describing attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation.
* These condition codes are the most useful:
	* CF: Carry flag. The most recent operation generated a carry out of the most significant bit. Used to detect overflow for unsigned operations.
	* ZF: Zero flag. The most recent operation yielded zero.
	* SF: Sign flag. The most recent operation yielded a negative value.
	* OF: Overflow flag. The most recent operation caused a two’s-complement overflow—either negative or positive.

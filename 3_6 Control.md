* Machine code provides two basic low-level mechanisms for implementing conditional behavior: it tests data values and then alters either the ==control flow== or the ==data flow== based on the results of these tests.
* The execution order of a set of machine code instructions can be altered with a `jump` instruction, indicating that control should pass to some other part of the program, possibly contingent on the result of some test.
